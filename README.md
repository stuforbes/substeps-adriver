Substeps - A-Driver
===================

This is an A-Driver implementation of the substeps-webdriver project, which can be found [here](https://github.com/technophobia/substeps-webdriver/ "Substeps Webdriver").

The step definitions themselves are largely the same. However, the implementation logic behind them use the A-Driver framework, meaning asynchronous polling is utilised with every call.
